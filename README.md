# Treasure-Run

The Treasure Run is a 3D adventure maze game built in Godot where you get to explore an ancient castle in search for a hidden treasure room. Walk through the hallways, mysterious rooms filled with items as you find your way to the final room filled with gold coins. Every turn might bring you closer or take you farther from your goal, so choose the right path to reach the treasure!!

## skills
From having no clue how a 3D game is developed to actually making one is huge for me, and I wanted to try it out for myself. I created this game in Godot, used tools to make the greybox, added some assets to it, then decorated it with props and added lighting throughout.

## Goal
- Explore the maze/castle
- choose path wisely
- find the hidden treasure room
